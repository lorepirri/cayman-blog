### Dynamic Flux Balance Analyis (dFBA)

This is basically an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model model combined with a normal [FBA](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1614) with a stoichiometry matrix **S** (species in rows, reactions in columns), and a velocity vector **v**. Note that the reactions include exchange reactions (e.g. glucose uptake, biomass accumulation, etc.) but the species do not include extracellular species. The FBA algorithm then finds the subspace of reaction velocities for which **Sv** = **0**. Some reactions are then bounded. One typically wants to maximise the flux through one reaction (e.g. biomass accumulation). This represents a well formulated linear programming problem.
What dFBA adds to it, is that it contains extracellular species such as glucose (and also biomass). ODEs describe how the extracellular species change over time. For instance:

*  dGlucose/dt = -k*Biomass, which sets the value of the glucose uptake reaction in the FBA submodel.
*  dBiomass/dt = %mu;*Biomass, where &mu; is the result of the FBA biomass reaction

The dFBA solver then alternates through FBA and ODE steps.

#### Dynamic Regulatory FBA
Is a dFBA combined with a Boolean network that explains which enzymes are off under what circumstances. That is, the Boolean network provides constraints to the dFBA model.
